# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built with React and Redux. It allows users to add, edit, toggle, and delete todo items. The application also includes filtering functionality to filter todo items based on their completion status.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ronishhh/Todo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application should now be running locally on your machine. You can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can start using the Todo application. Here are some key features:

- **Add Todo**: Enter a new todo item in the input field and press Enter to add it to the list.
- **Edit Todo**: Click on the "Edit" button next to a todo item to edit its title.
- **Toggle Todo**: Click on the checkbox next to a todo item to toggle its completion status.
- **Delete Todo**: Click on the "Delete" button next to a todo item to delete it from the list.
- **Filter Todos**: Use the dropdown menu to filter todo items based on their completion status.
